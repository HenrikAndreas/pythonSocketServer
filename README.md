# pythonSocketServer

A python chat server. This program allows multiple clients to connect ot the host server. It contains a very basic
login, and you have to register a user. The users get stored in a .dat file. It also stores all the messages sent,
and writes them out in the client terminal when the client connects, so that they can see previous messages.
The server will log all activity, including IP-addresses connected and specific times for the actions.

Server.py - For hosting the server

Client.py - connects to the Server's IP address. This IP address you must change within the program, and match it to the one of the server
